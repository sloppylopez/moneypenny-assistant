### Setup Instructions:

1. **Install Required Libraries**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install speech_recognition halo pynput
   ```

2. **Run the Script**: Save the above code in a file (for example, `voice_command_executor.py`) and run it using Python. The script will then listen for the Ctrl + Shift + F12 keyboard shortcut to activate listening.

3. **Activate Listening**: Press Ctrl + Shift + F12 to start listening. Say "Hello World" to see the command execution in action.

### Note:
- This script uses the Google Speech-to-Text API for voice recognition, which requires an active internet connection.
- The keystroke detection is tailored for simplicity. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific Linux environment or if additional key combinations are desired.
- Ensure your microphone permissions are properly configured for Python and the terminal or IDE you're using to run the script.
